# Research Segmentation Tool Front End

This repository contains the front-end implementation of a research segmentation tool, built using React. The tool is designed to offer specialized functionalities that greatly enhance the segmentation process for researchers while providing high-quality data outputs. 

## Features

- **Advanced Segmentation**: The front end provides an intuitive and powerful interface for researchers to perform complex image segmentation tasks. The tool leverages the capabilities of React to create a seamless and responsive user experience.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The user interface is designed with researchers in mind. It offers an easy-to-use set of tools and controls, allowing researchers to define segmentation boundaries with precision.

- **Real-time Visualization**: The React-based implementation allows for real-time visualization of the segmentation process. As researchers make adjustments to the segmentation parameters, they can immediately see the effects on the displayed image.

- **Interactive Feedback**: The tool provides interactive feedback during the segmentation process, helping researchers make informed decisions. This feature contributes to the production of high-quality segmented data.
